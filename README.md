MOVICO is an android-based application that allows users to Browse, Search, and Favorite movies both in theatres and upcoming. 

Browsing:
  Both tabs "Now Playing" and "Upcoming" give the user the ability to scroll and browse a variety of different movies of different genres. Each movie is accompanied by a "Detail" button that, when clicked, allows users to see an "Overview" of the movie, the general vote, and the genre the movie is qualified for.

Searching:
  The application allows users to search for movies using the movie titles. In the event that the user enters the name of the person instead of the title, the application will still populate results that include the keyword entered in the title of the movie.
  
  Favoriting:
    The user has the ability to favorite/save any movie they come across by clicking on the heart icon at the top of the movie's Detail page. Clicking this heart will save the movie in the "Favorite" tab so that the user can come back to it at any time. The app also displays a quick message to the user whenever a movie is added/removed from the favorites list.
